## ido-vertical-mode.el

Makes ido-mode display vertically.

This mode takes care of some caveats that are otherwise ugly to store in your init file.

It's **highly** recommended that you also use [`ido-ubiquitous`](https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/ido-ubiquitous) (on [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/)).

### Install via [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/)

`M-x` `package-install` `ido-vertical-mode`

### Turn it on

`M-x` `ido-vertical-mode` (it's a global mode)
